Human Resources Management System (HRMS) - Design

This project is a design prototype for a Human Resources Management System (HRMS) created during my time at university. The primary focus of this project was on developing a clean, modern, and dynamic UI design for an HRMS application.

While this project does not include backend functionality or full integration, it showcases the frontend design that includes several key HRMS pages such as dashboards, employee management, payroll, and performance reviews. The design features smooth animations and is visually sharp, creating a polished look that could serve as the basis for a fully functional HRMS system.

Key highlights of the design:

Modern and Clean UI: Sleek and professional layout with an emphasis on usability.
Dynamic Elements: Incorporates animations to enhance user interaction.
HRMS Pages: Includes mockups for employee management, payroll, and performance reviews.
Visually Sharp: Crisp, high-quality design elements that provide a polished look.
This project is shared for those interested in reviewing and drawing inspiration from a well-designed HRMS frontend.
