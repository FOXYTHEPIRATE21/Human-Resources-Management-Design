# Human Resources Management System (HRMS) - Design

This project is a **design prototype** for a **Human Resources Management System (HRMS)** created during my time at university. The main focus of this project was to develop a **clean, modern, and dynamic UI design** for an HRMS application using **.NET**, **Blazor**, **HTML**, **C#**, and **CSS**.

While the project does not include backend functionality or full integration, it showcases the **frontend design** with key HRMS pages such as dashboards, employee management, payroll, and performance reviews. The design features **smooth animations** and is visually sharp, creating a polished look that could serve as the basis for a fully functional HRMS system.

## Key Highlights of the Design:
- **Modern and Clean UI**: Sleek and professional layout with an emphasis on usability.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Incorporates animations to enhance user interaction.
- **HRMS Pages**: Includes mockups for employee management, payroll, and performance reviews.
- **Visually Sharp**: Crisp, high-quality design elements that provide a polished look.

## Technologies Used:
- **.NET**: Framework for building the project.
- **Blazor**: Used for building the dynamic and interactive frontend.
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the pages.
- **C#**: Logic and interaction for dynamic elements.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for the frontend.
